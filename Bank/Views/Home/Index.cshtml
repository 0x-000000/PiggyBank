    <h1>PiggyBank Project Introduction!</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        PiggyBank is an application platform that allows users to create accounts,<br />
        login, check funds, deposit funds, spend funds, transfer funds to another user, <br />
        calculate compound interest generated per year, and calculate income tax. <br />
        <br />
        Using the top navigation bar, you can test the register, member, and staff pages.<br />
        Currently, for Assignment 5, these pages are incomplete, but implement all of the <br />
        services we have made. Currently, the individual services have been uploaded to Webstrar, <br />
        but the application as a whole has not been yet. <br />
        <br />
        To test the various functionalities of this service, you can click Member and Staff to access <br />
        their respective sign in pages. To register a member account, you can use the Register page. <br />
        The staff account provided is "TA" with a password of "Cse445!" After logging in, you can test <br />
        the various functions in the Member/Staff pages. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The individual web services can be tested from the top navigation bar <br />
